IP-based Attendance Check
==========================

This module extends the HR Attendance module to add IP-based validation for attendance check-in/check-out operations.
It allows companies to restrict attendance registrations to specific IP addresses or ranges, ensuring that
employees can only record their attendance when they are physically present in the company network.

Key features:
------------
* IP whitelist configuration for attendance check-in/check-out
* Easy enable/disable of IP verification
* Visual feedback when attempting check-in/check-out from unauthorized IP
* Flexible configuration through settings menu
