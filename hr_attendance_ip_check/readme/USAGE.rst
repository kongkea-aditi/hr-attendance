Usage
=====

Regular Usage
------------
1. Employees attempt to check in/out as normal through the Attendance interface
2. If IP checking is enabled:
   * If the employee's IP is in the whitelist, check-in/check-out proceeds normally
   * If the employee's IP is not in the whitelist, a warning message appears
     and the check-in/check-out operation is blocked

Administrator Usage
-----------------
1. Go to Settings -> Human Resources -> Attendance
2. Enable or disable IP-based attendance check
3. Configure the whitelist of allowed IP addresses

Troubleshooting
-------------
* If an employee cannot check in/out:
  - Verify their IP address
  - Check if the IP is in the whitelist
  - Verify that IP checking is enabled
