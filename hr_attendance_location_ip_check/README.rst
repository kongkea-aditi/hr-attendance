This module adds IP-based validation to HR Attendance, ensuring employees can only check in or out from authorized work location IPs. Using CIDR ranges tied to work locations, it offers a scalable and flexible solution for managing attendance. You can configure global rules, location-specific settings, or even grant individual bypass permissions for employees. With support for multi-company environments and proper access controls, itâ€™s designed to fit the needs of organizations with multiple locations or remote teams.

Key Features
------------
* Work location-based IP validation using CIDR ranges
* Employee bypass options controlled by HR Managers
* Flexible setup for global and location-specific rules
* Scalable IP management for multi-location businesses
* Multi-company support with proper access controls

Usage
=====

Employee Check-in/out Process
-----------------------------
* Use standard attendance interface
* System validates IP address based on:
  1. Global IP check status
  2. Employee's work location configuration
  3. Allowed CIDR ranges

* Results:
  - Success: Check-in/out recorded
  - Failure: Error message shown
  - Bypass: Skips validation for authorized employees

Administrative Tasks
--------------------
* Configure CIDR ranges and priorities
* Manage bypass permissions
* Update or disable network ranges as needed

Development
===========

Core Components
---------------
1. Models:
   * `hr_attendance.py`: IP validation logic
   * `hr_work_location_cidr.py`: Network management
2. Security:
   * `ir.model.access.csv`: Access control
   * `security.xml`: Record rules
3. Views:
   * `hr_employee_views.xml`: Employee form
   * `hr_work_location_views.xml`: Location config

Testing Framework
-----------------
Includes access control tests, CIDR validation, multi-company scenarios, and bypass validations.

Contributing
------------
* Follow OCA guidelines
* Submit unit tests with changes
* Use proper commit messages

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Current Features
----------------
- Single work location IP validation based on CIDR
- Support for bypass permissions managed by HR Managers
- Fully compatible with Odoo's default work location architecture

Future Enhancements
-------------------
- Develop a separate module to support multiple work locations per employee
- Integrate the multiple work locations module with this module for IP validation
- Ensure modularity for reuse across other HR functionalities
- Maintain backward compatibility with single work location setups
- Extend support for Odoo versions 17 and 18, including modular updates for compatibility

This module draws inspiration from the CIDR-based validation concepts proposed in `PR #168 <https://github.com/OCA/hr-attendance/pull/168>`_ by `sonhd91 <https://github.com/sonhd91>`. However, this implementation takes a different architectural approach by focusing on **work location-based IP validation**. By linking CIDR ranges directly to work locations, it provides enhanced scalability and flexibility for enterprises with multiple locations or distributed teams.
