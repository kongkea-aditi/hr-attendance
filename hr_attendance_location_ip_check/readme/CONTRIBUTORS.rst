This module draws inspiration from the CIDR-based validation concepts proposed in `PR #168 <https://github.com/OCA/hr-attendance/pull/168>`_ by `sonhd91 <https://github.com/sonhd91>`. However, this implementation takes a different architectural approach by focusing on **work location-based IP validation**. By linking CIDR ranges directly to work locations, it provides enhanced scalability and flexibility for enterprises with multiple locations or distributed teams.
